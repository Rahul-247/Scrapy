"b'108.  Since it is a network that uses switch, every packet goes through two links, one from source to switch and other from switch to destination. Since there are 10000 bits and packet size is 5000, two packets are sent. Transmission time for each packet is 5000 / 10^7 bits per second links. Each link has a propagation delay of 20 microseconds. The switch begins forwarding a packet 35 microseconds after it receives the same.
